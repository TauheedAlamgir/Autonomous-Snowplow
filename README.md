# Autonomous Snowplow Robot
Project for SYSC 4805 – Carleton University

Overview:
This project focuses on developing an autonomous snowplow robot that detects obstacles, follows boundaries, and clears cube-shaped objects simulating snow. It combines sensor integration, movement control, and real-time communication using Arduino microcontrollers.

Features:
- Obstacle detection (Ultrasonic, ToF sensors)
- Line following using IR sensors
- PID-based movement control
- Custom 3D-printed plow design
- Integrated testing for speed, navigation, and obstacle avoidance

Hardware & Software:
- Microcontrollers: Arduino DUE, Arduino Nano Every
- Sensors: Ultrasonic, ToF, IMU, Line Follower
- Language: C/C++ (Arduino)
- Tools: AutoCAD, Arduino IDE
